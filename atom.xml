    <link href="http://darkzeroman.github.io/blog/2013/09/22/rest-overview/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-22T01:49:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://darkzeroman.github.io/blog/2013/09/22/rest-overview</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently had an interview where we went over REST API design. I really never had any experience in designing APIs, but rather using them. After the interviewer and I talked about ways to design an API I decided I wanted to go back and really think about how to make a proper RESTful interface and the following are the notes that might be helpful for others to glance over when they are thinking about making a REST API. This conversation of RESTful will reference Rails at times because that was my experience with REST and lots of behaviors in Rails make sense once you consider how REST works.</p>

<h2 id="think-nouns">Think Nouns</h2>

<p>If you think about the API endpoints available when using a scaffold in Rails, the types of names associated with these endpoints tend to be nouns for a reason. Which makes sense and follows the guidelines for REST very well.</p>

<p>Also, think plural nouns.</p>

<p>Bad:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class=""><span class="line">/all_dogs
</span><span class="line">/list_customers</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Good</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class=""><span class="line">/dogs
</span><span class="line">/customers</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<h2 id="use-parameters">Use Parameters</h2>

<p>Parameters for urls are in the format <code>/noun?name=value&amp;name2=value2</code> and this should be the way to get more information for a REST command that might not fit within the REST-way of doing things. Think about queries which can filter the type of list being asked when using <code>/noun</code> or something similar.</p>

<p>The parameters can be used by using the params object in a controller’s method in Rails.</p>

<p>Examples for parameters: filtering the type of response, deciding what type of data to return, pagination</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class=""><span class="line">/dogs?fields=name,color,location
</span><span class="line">/dogs?field=name,color,location&amp;limit=10&amp;offset=20</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Use camel casing for JSON property names.</p>

<h2 id="errors">Errors</h2>

<p>Errors should be handled from the server and they should be returned definitely if something goes wrong and possibly if the query didn’t have an issue.</p>

<p>Error messages are usually in JSON format, the following shows some possible formats.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class=""><span class="line">type: OAuthException
</span><span class="line">message: error_message_here</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>
<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class=""><span class="line">status: http_status_code
</span><span class="line">message: text
</span><span class="line">code: num
</span><span class="line">more_info: url</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>
<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class=""><span class="line">code: http_status_code
</span><span class="line">message: error_message</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<h2 id="response-format">Response Format</h2>

<p>Sometimes the response needed isn’t normal HTML or text, it could be JSON. Remember in Rails a method can respond in multiple formats, one of them could be JSON. </p>

<p>So for a client to request a response to a query in json, the client can either append a parameter, add <code>.json</code> to the end of the noun, or put <code>application/json</code> in the accept type in the header.</p>

<h2 id="non-nouns">Non-Nouns</h2>

<p>Use verbs for actions such as convert, calculate, etc.</p>

<p><code>/convert?from=EURO&amp;to=CNY&amp;amount=10</code></p>

<h2 id="limited-http-methods-alternatives">Limited HTTP Methods Alternatives</h2>

<p>Put method type as a parameter to query, example:</p>

<p><code>/dogs?method=post</code></p>

    <id>http://darkzeroman.github.io/blog/2013/09/20/unique-string-permutations-with-repeated-slash-duplicated-characters</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="problem">Problem</h1>

<p>How do you find the number of unique words from a collection of letters contain duplicates?</p>

<p>Word here represents a specific orderings of letters.</p>

<p>Example: if a collection of letters is [a,b,b], possible words are aab, aba, baa.</p>

<h1 id="examples">Examples</h1>

<p>Input: RRD</p>

<p>Output: 3, options are RRD, RDR, DRR</p>

<p>Input: RRDD</p>

<p>Output: 6, RDDR, DRRD, RDRD, DRDR, RRDD, DDRR</p>

<h1 id="why-cant-we-use-other-formulas">Why Can’t We Use Other Formulas?</h1>

<p>Let’s suppose the collection of letters is: RRD.</p>

<p>To differentiate between the two Rs, let’s denote them as R1 and R2.</p>

<h3 id="permutation-formula-n">Permutation Formula (n!)</h3>

<p>It doesn’t make sense to use the permutation formula, because even though R1-R2-D is a different permutation from R2-R1-D, it is the same word (using our definition from before).</p>

<h3 id="combination-formula-nck">Combination Formula (nCk)</h3>

<p>But can we use the combinations formula? Kind of, we will use a related formula, but we can’t use it directly at the moment. Why?</p>

<p>Because what are we choosing? How does this formula work for repeated/duplicated letters? We’re not choosing 2 letters from all the letters, we want to make unique words!</p>

<h1 id="so-how-to-think-about-this-problem">So How To Think About This Problem?</h1>

<h3 id="defining-the-formula">Defining the formula</h3>
<p>Let’s think about it this way, C is the number of unique letter combinations, or unique words.</p>

<p>But remember, for each C (aka unique word), if there are repeated letters, there can be more that one permutation which will still yield the same word. We need to account for that.</p>

<p>Next, there is a calculable total number of permutations, which can be found by the permutation formula, n!, where n is the size of the collection of letters.</p>

<p>So with that in mind, think about following equation and validate it to yourself:</p>

<p>(Number of unique letter combinations, or C) x (All of the permutations of C which result in the same word) = Total number of permutations</p>

<p>or </p>

<p>C * Number_Perms_For_Each = n!</p>

<h2 id="number-of-permutations-for-each-unique-word">Number of Permutations for Each Unique Word</h2>

<p>Let’s think about the collection of letters as [D1, D2, R1, R2] and word DDRR.</p>

<p>We want to come up with the number of permutations of the letters that yield the same word. </p>

<p>The valid permutations: [D2, D1, R1, R2], [D1, D2, R2, R1], [D1, D2, R2, R1], [D2, D1, R2, R1].</p>

<p>One way to think about this is that the number of ways to switch letters and have the same word is to perform a permutation for each letter group i, which is equal to numLetters(i) and then multiplying all of these together.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
n = n_{0}, n_{0}, n_{0}, n_{1}, n_{1}, ..., n_{k}
</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\prod^{k}_{i = 0} (num(n_{i}))!
</script>

<h3 id="back-to-the-formula">Back to the formula</h3>

<p>Our unknown is C, we can calculate the n!, and finally we can find the number of permutations of C because we know it will contain a specified number of letters types and their frequency.</p>

<p>So the formula turns into:</p>

<p>C = n! / Number_Perms_For_Each</p>

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>

<p>Say we have RRDD, we know R should show up twice and D should show up twice.</p>

<p>For each combination, there are many permutations of letters that result in the same word, this will be 2!2!</p>

<p>C = 4! / ( 2! * 2!) = 4 * 3 / 2 = 2 * 3 = 6</p>

<p>Which makes sense, since the valid six unique words are: RRDD, DDRR, RDDR, DRRD, RDRD, DRDR.</p>

<p>I want to think about this a bit more.</p>

<p>Though, honestly this is just a multinomial expansion, but this is just another way of looking at it.</p>

    <updated>2013-09-17T01:18:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://darkzeroman.github.io/blog/2013/09/17/arraylist-vs-linkedlist</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been reviewing some material for interviews and something new I learned today is the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList.</p>

<h2 id="the-big-o-notes">The Big O Notes</h2>

<p>For just review, the Big O for the operations for each data structure is:</p>

<p>For LinkedList</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class=""><span class="line">* get is O(n)
</span><span class="line">* add is O(1)
</span><span class="line">* remove is O(n)
</span><span class="line">* Iterator.remove is O(1)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>For ArrayList
&lt;div class=&#8217;bogus-wrapper&#8217;&gt;<notextile><figure class="code">&lt;div class=&#8221;highlight&#8221;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#8221;gutter&#8221;&gt;&lt;pre class=&#8221;line-numbers&#8221;&gt;<span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#8217;code&#8217;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;<code class=""><span class="line">* get is O(1)
</span><span class="line">* add is O(1) amortized, but O(n)
</span><span class="line">* remove is O(n)</span></code>&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</figure></notextile>&lt;/div&gt;</p>

<h2 id="but-why-the-difference">But why the difference?</h2>

<p>Well, something that’s obvious to me now, but wasn’t before is that <strong>Array</strong>List is actually backed by an array. </p>

<p>So what does that mean? That means that on average, adding an element to the ArrayList is constant time, since it just adds it to the next empty index. But there can be a case when the backing array is full and it needs to be made bigger. So then a new array is made, the elements are copied over, which leads to an operation of O(n).</p>

<p>And now the reason why remove is O(n) makes sense, if the first element was to be removed, the whole array must be shifted.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>So when does LinkedList make sense? When you want to quickly add something to a data structure and the difference between ArrayList is that the operation is always O(1) instead of amortized O(1).</p>

<p>ArrayList is good for when O(1) operations are needed for adding/getting, but remember that if the list grows by a large amount that reinitializing the backing array will be costly.</p>

<p>By the way, an alternative for LinkedList is ArrayDeque which gives constant operations for adding/removing at both ends of the queue. I was first exposed to this data structure in Python, where it was called deque.</p>

<h2 id="update">Update</h2>

<p>I recently added notes for Java Collections on my GitHub Notes Repository. <a href="https://github.com/darkzeroman/Notes/blob/master/JavaCollections.md">Check it out!</a></p>

    <id>http://darkzeroman.github.io/blog/2013/09/15/android-styling-guide</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had the chance to interview with <a href="http://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a> this past week. I got the opportunity because a person with who I worked on an Android application called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.doug.nextbus&amp;hl=en">GT NextBus</a> was around on campus interviewing.</p>

<p>And then I wanted to go back over my code just to refresh my mind about the project. As I was looking over the code base I realized that I wrote pretty good documentation describing the features I was working on and my expectations of other people working on the project.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/darkzeroman/nextbus">GitHub Repo</a></p>

<p>One of the first things I do when using a new language for a project is spend a good amount of time reading language style guidelines There are many reasons for this, such as learning to write maintainable code and learning another view point on how code should be written. I did with Javascript (using online resources and JSLint), Java (Lots of reading of Apache coding style guides), and Android (used Google Android Style Guides).</p>

<p>I really liked the Android Styling Guideline and decided to put together a summary of all the major points for anyone who wants to skim it.</p>

<p>The notes are in my <a href="http://github.com/notes">Notes</a> repository which I use as a knowledge center for many Computer Science concepts.</p>

<p>So check out this document and others which include notes about Databases, Networking, or Object Oriented Programming.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="context">Context</h2>

<p>When I browse Reddit or another similar website there are many images that I want to share with someone. The process currently looks like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Copy URL to clipboard</li>
  <li>Paste URL to friend</li>
  <li>Friend clicks URL</li>
  <li>Friend notices funny image</li>
  <li>Repeat above</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>

<p>This process works great when I’m only sharing 1 or 2 images, but sometimes me and my buddy spend a good 10 minutes sending random images to each other and this process becomes inefficient. </p>

<p>I’m thinking about building a web app that will dynamically load any type of content for both users. </p>

<p>The use case is the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>User 1 sends User 2 a link to the web app</li>
  <li>User 1 can pass a link to the web app, which will load link automatically for User 2</li>
  <li>Both users can automatically load content for each other</li>
</ul>

<p>How to build this?</p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

<p>Usually clients use AJAX to poll a server for status updates, but in this case, it would make sense for either the clients communicate directly or the server to push to clients updates. </p>

<p>I have looked into browser to browser communication platforms like WebRTC, but I don’t feel that is at a usable state for this type of project. </p>

<p>For the server to push updates to the client, the options are some sort of web sockets. That leaves two major tools: socket.io and SockJS.</p>

<p>After doing a little bit of Googling it seems the common consensus is that SockJS is better than socket.io.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This seems to be a pretty easy project to do, it seems like with SockJS lots of the hard implementation details are taken care of. I want to cover the concepts of SockJS in another blog post though!</p>

    <link href="http://darkzeroman.github.io/blog/2013/09/07/reddit-repost-blocker/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-07T03:50:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://darkzeroman.github.io/blog/2013/09/07/reddit-repost-blocker</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A large issue with <a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a> is that content is regularly submitted again and again (otherwise known as reposting). </p>

<p>A vocal minority always posts comments about how the image has been posted many times before, sometimes the same day, week, or month.</p>

<p>So I started to think about how I can make a Reddit Enhancement Suite extension that would hide reposts. </p>

<p>I started to think about how this would work and there are a few ways I could see this working.</p>

<h2 id="but-first-why">But first, why?</h2>

<h3 id="pros">Pros</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Reposts suck. An argument that the content on Reddit should be fresh and seeing the same submission over and over would decrease the quality of the website.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cons">Cons</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Reposts are a real part of Reddit, just because something is reposted doesn’t mean that there won’t be an interesting addition to the discussion a user has never seen before.</li>
  <li>I remember when I used to block the imgur domain using Reddit Enhancement Suite, the extension use to just hide the submissions. So what would happen is that whenever I went to the front page I would only see two actual posts because almost everything was imgur links. For this extension, it would be counter-productive to block most of the submissions from the front page because they are reposts.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="one-possible-implementation">One Possible Implementation</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Keep track of all front page posts for a long time (month or so, to start) into a data store (take your pick, mongo or sql)</li>
  <li>The extension checks the url of the post against the database and if it already exists hide the submission post.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="issues">Issues:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Getting the data can take a while, but I found other people who have been archiving Reddit data.</li>
  <li>Checking against the data store for a certain URL can take a while, of course hashing can make it easier but eventually collisions can happen.
    <ul>
      <li>One way to make things faster is to use some sort of hashing strategy that can check different hashtables for a URL. I remember that some data stores reverse a URL to make this easier. For example, the strategy is to store a domain in the format com.vvohra.subdomain so the com’s, net’s, etc can be stored on different servers to speed up checking of data.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="existing-solutions">Existing Solutions</h2>
<p><a href="http://karmadecay.com">Karma Decay</a> shows which images have been reposted. I think it’s similar to TinEye, so it should be able to handle images from different domains and changed sizes. It seems Karma Decay has an extension which allows a user to notice a submission has duplicates.</p>

<p>Another extension I found was <a href="http://node.angryzor.com/~rtytgat/repostblocker/">Repost Blocker</a>, which seems to be exactly what I brainstormed. Looking through the documentation, it seems like this extension uses Karma Decay to check for reposts.</p>

<p>Just a short brainstorming activity, gotta think some more!</p>

    <updated>2013-08-18T19:04:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://darkzeroman.github.io/blog/2013/08/18/osx-shortcuts</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I started to really use keyboard shortcuts when I started to use VIM. But what I dislike is that I can’t HJKL in another applications, which is tough to get over because I spent so much time learning I couldn’t use them in other applications!</p>

<p>There are ways to use VIM keybindings in other applications, such as Vimperator, Vimium, Eclim, etc. But the hardest is that getting VIM keybindings to function means that there needs to be support for the insert, normal modes (<a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Learning_the_vi_Editor/Vim/Modes">More here</a>) to work correctly. And this is difficult to do in an effective manner!</p>

<p>So that’s why the Emacs keybindings make sense! Instead of having to try to mess around with modes, I can just use Control + Key to complete an operation. The bad part about using Control is that it is on the bottom left part of a Macbook keyboard, but I do remember that people always mentioned to me that they would remap the Caps Lock key to Control.</p>

<p>I am sad that I can’t switch into ALL CAPS mode (which is good to have when I’m trying to write proper SQL), but being able to control the cursor without having to move my hands to the arrow keys is something I am willing to give up. The one bad part is that these keyboards shortcuts are not always available in all programs, but it works in terminal, Chrome toolbar, and text editors! Which is really covers most of the stuff I do anyway!</p>

<p>The following is a summary of the keyboard shortcuts I find most important to know. 
<em>Cursor is the small box or vertical line that shows where you are currently typing.</em></p>

<h2 id="movement">Movement</h2>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: center">Keyboard Shortcut</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">Command</th>

  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">Control + A</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">Control + P</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Previous Line</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">Control + N</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Next Line</td>

      <td style="text-align: center">Move Cursor Forward</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">Control + B</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Move Cursor Backward</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">Control + V</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Scroll Down</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="editing">Editing</h2>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Keyboard Shortcut</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">Command</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Control + K</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Cut From Cursor to End of Line (Cut)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Control + Y</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Paste The Text Removed By Control + K</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Control + H</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Backspace</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Control + D</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Forward Backspace</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Control + T</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Transpose letters *</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Control + O</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Insert Line Break</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><br /></p>

<p>* If the cursor is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>between two letters, the two letters will be switched. </li>
  <li>is in a white space between two words, the two words will be switched.</li>
</ul>

Also, he is interested in Computer Science and said he would like tips to know what to install for a good workstation setup.</p>

<p>Before an internship I primarily used a Linux box and was comfortable using the command line, but always had trouble with various things such as sound, turning on after a sleep, and performance issues on my previous Linux laptop. This might have been due to the fact that the machine wasn’t the highest quality machine and might not have been a good fit for Ubuntu.</p>

<p>As I was making the list I figured it would be good to put up the list online so others can look at my setup and decide whether they want to use any of the tools I do.</p>

    <updated>2013-08-18T18:37:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://darkzeroman.github.io/blog/2013/08/18/efficient-sql</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During one of my interviews I was asked whether I knew how to make SQL queries more efficient. At that point in time I had barely used SQL and had to ask the interviewer to move on to another subject. </p>

<p>But since I have started to use SQL in the <a href="http://dssg.io">DSSG Program</a> I’ve started to deal with SQL queries that can possibly take a while to run. And I started to wonder how to make SQL queries more efficient and I found this <a href="http://www.databasejournal.com/features/mssql/article.php/1437391/Transact-SQL-Optimization-Tips.htm">article</a>.</p>

<p>The following is a quick summary of link.</p>

<h2 id="tips-to-speed-up-queries">Tips to Speed Up Queries</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Try to restrict the queries result set by using the WHERE clause.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>This one seems obvious.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Try to restrict the queries result st by returning only the particular columns from the table, not all the table’s columns.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Another one that seems obvious.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>If you need to return the total table’s row count, use an alternative instead of <code>SELECT COUNT(*)</code> statement.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>This one is interesting because I didn’t know there were alternatives, I usually do run the <code>SELECT COUNT(*)</code> statement! I will update how to get the table count in Postgres soon.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Try to avoid the HAVING clause whenever possible.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>This is an interesting one, I wouldn’t think the HAVING clause would be that computationally expensive, but a good point is made that if it’s possible to filter out unneeded values with a WHERE clause, that should be used.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Use SELECT statements with LIMIT keyword if you need to return only the first n rows.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Makes sense, I do this quite often when I am testing to make sure my query is running as expected. Usually used to run join on a subset before running it on the whole data set.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Try to use UNION ALL statement stead of UNION.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>UNION ALL does not look for duplicates while UNION does look for duplicates whether they exist or not.</p>

<hr />

<p>Something I’ve learned about recently is Postgres’ EXPLAIN and ANALYZE. More information is to be added soon.</p>

<p>I will add more SQL efficiency tips as I come across them!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To be able to build Javascript in Sublime Text, it’s necessary to add a new Build System.</p>

<p>To be able to do that, it’s necessary to first have Node installed, so head over to <a href="http://nodejs.org/download/">Node.js homepage</a> to install node.js first.</p>

<p>With the Sublime Text program open, navigate to <code>Tools</code> -&gt; <code>Build System</code> -&gt; <code>New Build System ...</code></p>

<p>And add the following:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span>Node.sublime-build</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

<p>It might be necessary to adjust the path to node for your own setup.</p>

<p>Now save, restart Sublime Text, and you should be able to build Javascript with Sublime Text!</p>
